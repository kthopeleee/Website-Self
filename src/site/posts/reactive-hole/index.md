In the past few weeks I've been messing with turning some of my doodles into little apps.

Here's a (fairly) private and (mostly) secure P2P transfer thingy:

I wonder what are the other tools/digital products that are so simple, so low-tech that we'd choose them over the alternatives purely because of their aesthetics or how they make us feel.

I'm not talking about anything more complex than the digital version of a coffee mug or a keychain.

### By default, these objects:

- serve a (simple) purpose
- are completely replaceable

We pick them because: they're pretty _or_ ugly, playful _or_ boring. As long as they feel unique to us, we're happy to make a choice. The choice doesn't really matter though, the functionality is the same. We make the choice meaningful by attributing value to certain features (objectively important or not) that these items posess. This is the experience economy at its finest. -->
