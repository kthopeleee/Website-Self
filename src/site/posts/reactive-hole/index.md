In the past few weeks I've been messing with turning some of my doodles into little apps.

What are the other tools/digital products that are so simple, so low-tech that we'd choose them over the alternatives purely because of their aesthetics or how they make us feel?

I'm not talking about anything more complex than the digital version of a coffee mug or a keychain. Neither serves an important purpose and both are anything but irreplaceable. I don't care whether the thing in front of me is pretty or ugly, playful or boring. What I care about is whether it feels mine.

This might sound like I'm procrastinating (likely) or talking about the experience economy (also, likely). But, what I really have in mind are toys.

Now, if you were to build a toy (not a <a href='https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/tommy-the-toe/id1498417487' target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Ugh, especially not one that starts as a 1 day project and ends up taking 3 months">game</a> and not a tool), [what would that be](/posts/hi)?
