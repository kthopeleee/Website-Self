## What? 

Ulysses falls into the (somewhat boring) category of minimalistic writing tools, at least on the surface.

In fact, it's unashamedly stupid. It's idiotic compared to the zen-mode enabled in your text editor. Somehow, it supports even less text-editing features than a mindless text input. As I was prototyping it, I found it amusing how hard it was to build a text editor so incapable of virtually anything.

Ulysses will make it hard to apply basic edits to your text. Structural edits are impossible, as you'll be able to see only a few lines of text, fading away, losing their importance. You can't scroll. Basic edits are _possible_, if you're stubborn, but Ulysses will strive to annoy you enough that eventually you'll give up and start writing without editing _yourself_ and let your thoughts flow uninterrupted. 

Don't get me wrong, Ulysses isn't mean. He's just removing some of the overlooked distractions. It has a goal, I promise.

## Why? 

The goal of Ulysses is to put you in the state of flow by writing in an unconstrained, linear manner. 

You might have heard an annecdote about Kerouac having ~written~ typed On the Road in 3 weeks, on a 4 meter long piece of paper. You might've read the first draft of the book and, if you're a bit like me, thought it read like gibberish. Yet still, it is the Holy Book of 60's counter-culture, having inspired and shaped generations. One of the most impactful posts I've read recently comes from an author who used to dim the screen of his laptop when writing, so he couldn't easily see the already typed words. He'd make editing hard enough to force himself to focus on the narrative. Annoyingly enough, I forgot his name, so if you happen to know him, please let me know! Just like with Kerouac who in a few weeks typed a story being a product of thousands of experiences, this mysterious author has already done his research. Edits can be applied later. Huxley didn't get bored whilst reading On the Road because of the story, but because it was _too long_. 

Our attention spans have become shorter to the point where a species we are losing one of our evolutionary advantages—we're becoming terrible communicators. This is something I'm personally struggling with more than ever. Writing regularly helps us structure our thoughts and take a step back from ourselves, gain perspective. It can be a meditative or at least calming experience, which is something I could use.

You might want to use it to develop a better writing habit, increase the fluency in a new language or just keep it on the side of the screen when working and take impromptu notes—the one's you'd never read again, but you put them down so you can remember them by doing so. At least, this is how I use it.
