This was supposed to be a longer post, but I'm trying to learn with getting things like this out more quickly, instead of yak shaving or letting them fester in a drafts folder. Let me know if there's anything specific that piqued your attention.

<style>
.rotate {
    animation: spin-those-snakes 3s 1s linear infinite both;
}
@keyframes spin-those-snakes {
    from{ transform: scale(.6) rotate(0); }
    to { transform: scale(.6) rotate(360deg); }
}

The drawings in the post are mine, but the credit for ideas many of them should go to my old colleague, Gel Goldsby. You can find more about her [here]() and in the resources at the bottom of this post, where I'll link to resources which tackle the topic with more depth.

You might have heard about pair programming from a colleague or even tried it yourself.
