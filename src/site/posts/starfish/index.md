This one will be quick. I recently facilitated a retrospective for a team made up of a mix old and new people. This is a rapidly growing organisation, so naturally the conversation quickly shifted to their process and practice.

I had an old template of the [Starfish](https://www.funretrospectives.com/starfish/) team activity, which a) fits the use-case and b) is quite fun to run, so I dug it out and pasted into Procreate.

As always, it should work fine as a background for Mural, Miro, Figma Jam board or whatever is your jam (mine's fig).

Now, although I'm a fan of Funretros, I still believe that my Starfish is superior to their examples, as it's wearing a slingsuit.
