description: "A retrospective template"

This one will be quick. Recently I facilitated a retrospective for a team being is a mix old and new people, in a rapidly growing org. So, naturally after a few sessions the conversation shifted to their process and practice. I had an old template of a [Starfish](https://www.funretrospectives.com/starfish/) team activity, which neatly fits the use-case and is quite fun to run, so I dug it out and pasted into Figma.

Funretros are great, but, and hear me out here, if you _really_ care about giving your retros this little extra touch, and happen to be running a _practice-focused_ retro soon, what's a better way of doing that than by using this complimentary template with <a target='_blank' href='/images/starfish/template.png'>a&nbsp;starfish wearing a slingsuit</a>?

    The most fun, creative, and high-performing (for the lack of a better word) and "experienced" teams I worked with are not much different from a new bunch of people starting from scratch. They constantly evaluate their practice, are not afraid to experiment, introduce new behaviours or kill off the ones that are slowing us down. There's is mess, of course. And there's is stress, but everything is small, manageable.

    Many projects or teams start in a honeymoon phase. The foundations for the new work are established, you design your board, decide to start using TDD and pairing, manage the tech debt and avoid the tempation to take shortcuts. And, then everything goes to shit. I'm not going to delve into the specifics, pick your own flavour. 1000s of articles have been written about it, humans are messy. Minimising the feedback loop, experimentation is the best way of allowing you to periodically look down on the pavemenent, so the size of the shit you're stepping into is manageable, and then look ahead so you sort of know where you're going, or at least don't get lost. But I digress.

As always, it should work fine as a background for Mural, Miro, Figma Jam board or whatever is your jam (fig's mine).
