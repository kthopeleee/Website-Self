Are you working on something new, exciting or weird?

Are you learning a new piece tech or just looking for someone to bounce off an idea that has been haunting you for some time?

I'm available 5 times a week for a coffee and a chat about ideas big and small. There's no specific format to thisâ€”ask me any question and I'll see if I can help, free of charge.

I'm just curious to see who you are and what you've been up to.

I also have a bi-weekly 2h slot which I use for pair programming and mentoring sessions with friends, old and new.
