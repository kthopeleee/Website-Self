> Are you working on something new, exciting or weird?

Are you learning about a new piece tech or just looking for someone to bounce off an idea that has been haunting you for some time?

Brilliant!

I'm available throughout the week for a <a href="https://calendly.com/hey_hey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coffee and a chat</a> about ideas big and small. There's no specific format to this‚Äîask me any question and I'll see if I can help, free of charge.

I also have a <a href="https://calendly.com/hey_hey/60min" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bi-weekly 2h slot</a> which I use for pair programming and mentoring sessions with friends, old and new.

Should none if this suit you, feel free to call me for a [delicious 3 minute rant](https://calendly.com/hey_hey/3-minute-rant). It's simple: you rant, I listen.

We spend the remaining 7 minutes staring into the void, contemplating the pointlessness of our endeavors and the strange pleasure of hyperventilation.

A few days later I might text you back with a solution to your problem.

Honestly though, I'm just curious to see who you are and what you've been up to.
