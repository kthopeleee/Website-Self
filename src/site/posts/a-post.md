I’ve spent the past 10+ years [helping businesses](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/rafalpast) to move towards digital & mobile.

Recently, I made an app called [Façade](http://facade.photo/), it makes rainbows.

I love [photography](https://www.instagram.com/rafalpast/).

It was our last night in Granada. My boyfriend and I were sun-baked, bruised and scraped from a week of roaming the hills and forests like a pair of carefree, vagrant children. When he said, “let’s go somewhere new” he was talking about a place to eat. But to me it sounded like a call to adventure. I was desperate to get out of my own head and forget we were flying back home the next day. London felt like a memory from a past life. I darted ahead over a little hill, which landed us directly in the middle of the most formidable religious procession I’ve ever seen.

La Fiesta de Maria Santisima de la Aurora snaked up and down the length of the street and out of view. It seemed to contain the entire neighbourhood’s population. Everybody was here. In the stream of people, town officials and police mixed with elderly grandmothers and coquettish teenagers in high heels. A glamorous woman in her forties spotted my camera and started fixing her veil. The brass band from the local high-school nervously arranged their sheet music.

The common front-matter data for all of the files in the posts section are abstracted into a `posts.json` file so that we don't need to repeat that on every file. Handy.

### It looks like this:
